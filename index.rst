Experiential Robotics Platform (XRP)
====================================

What Is the XRP Platform?
-------------------------

The XRP (Experiential Robotics Platform) [beta], developed through a collaboration 
between WPI and DEKA Research & Development Corp., aims to level the STEM playing 
field globally and create a future generation of STEM innovators and technology 
leaders.

The robot kits you received are designed to operate autonomously and perform 
basic tasks. Its simple, tool-free assembly means robots can be built quickly, 
and replacement parts can be easily 3-D printed. As part of this platform, 
WPI will provide virtual support through online courses and will guide students 
and teachers through the new system, including the ability to scale up using 
the same hardware with free software updates. 

The XRP platform is part of WPI's global STEM education initiative, 
which will bring inspiration and possibility to STEM education in 
ways that make it available to all.
