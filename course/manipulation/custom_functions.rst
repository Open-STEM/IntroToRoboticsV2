Introduction to Manipulation
============================

Now that we've covered how to move the XRP arm to specific angles, we can start to think about how to use the arm 
to pick up objects. In this section, we'll cover how to use the arm to pick up a basket used for your final project.

Picking up a Basket 
-------------------

Let's first think about what the process of picking up a basket would look like. 

First, we can assume that the robot is right in front of the basket. We can also assume that the basket is on the ground,
and that the robot is able to move its arm to a position where it can reach the basket.

Then, we can back up until the robot is a safe distance away from the basket. We can then move the arm down until the arm is at the right height. 

Finally, we can move the arm forward until the basket is in the robot's grasp and then raise the arm back up to gain control of the basket.

    Try placing your robot in front of a basket and then writing a program to pick up the basket.


Here is a video of the robot picking up a basket:
