Module Overview
===============

In this module students will:

* Understand the task of following a line with the robot
* Learn to use the reflectance sensor to detect the line
* Write simple programs for detecting and responding to lines
* Write simple programs to follow lines
* Enhance the simple program with better sensor measurements and calculations to
  follow the line more smoothly.

At the end of this module, students will be able to:

* Discuss robot navigation concepts with their classmates
* Get their robot to follow a line 
* Develop simple sensor logic control for robot decision making
